            <h2>After the Field Trip</h2>
            <p>Kyle, Alex, Tyrone, Shein, and Andrhey had just returned from their unforgettable field trip to Palm Jumeirah. 
            They were tired but excited, still buzzing from everything they saw—especially the tall tower with the glass floor.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Famous Moment</h2>
            <p>During their free period before dismissal, they couldn’t stop talking about one specific moment. 
            Alex had been standing over the glass floor, staring straight down at the incredible height beneath his feet. 
            Just when he was focusing hard, Tyrone quietly walked up behind him and shouted, “BOO!”</p>

            <p>Alex jumped so high it looked like he was about to break the world record. 
            Kyle almost fell laughing, Shein was wheezing, and Andrhey had to hold the railing because he was laughing so much. 
            Even Alex eventually laughed—though he still denied being scared.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Non-Stop Teasing</h2>
            <p>For the rest of the break, the group reenacted the moment again and again.  
            Tyrone kept saying, “Bro, you should’ve seen your face,” 
            while Alex kept defending himself with, “I WASN’T SCARED, IT WAS THE WIND.”
            Nobody bought it for a second.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Movie Time Before Dismissal</h2>
            <p>Eventually, they calmed down and gathered around their laptop to watch a movie. 
            While the rest of the classroom buzzed with loud chatter, games, and conversations, the five of them stayed in their own little circle.  
            Their classmates were making noise everywhere, but they didn’t mind—  
            they watched their movie, laughed quietly, and enjoyed the last peaceful moments before dismissal.</p>
